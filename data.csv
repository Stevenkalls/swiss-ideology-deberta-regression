"The rule that no more than one member of the Federal Council may come from the same canton will be abolished. The Federal Assembly, however, must ensure that the country's regions and language areas are adequately represented.",0.00 ,0.18 
"The new Article 24 decrees of the Federal Constitution grants the federal government the authority to issue regulations in the field of organ, tissue, and cell transplantation (paragraph 1). In doing so, the federal government must ensure the protection of human dignity, personality, and health; this also includes animal organs, tissue, and cells; consequently, the federal government can also regulate the particularly controversial xenotransplantation. Paragraph 2 assigns the federal government the task of establishing criteria for the fair allocation of organs. Paragraph 3 stipulates that donations are gratuitous and prohibits trading in human parts.",-0.39 ,-0.11 
"The aim of the initiative is to increase tax incentives for and maintain owner-occupied housing. Five measures are planned for this purpose: 1. Savings for the purchase of owner-occupied housing are to be deducted from income. 2. Tax relief for funds from Pillars 2 and 3a of retirement savings intended for the purchase of homeownership. 3./4. The imputed rental value is to be set at a reasonable level and reduced for up to ten years after the initial purchase. 5. After that, it is unchangeable until any change of ownership.",0.49 ,-0.13 
"The partial revision of the Spatial Planning Act includes three significant changes. Buildings and facilities for off-land farming (fattening farms, greenhouses) are now permitted in agricultural zones. Furthermore, the conversion of existing buildings to commercial purposes will be permitted, provided this ensures the continued existence of the main agricultural or horticultural business. Finally, agricultural residential buildings that are preserved in their original structure (e.g., no dilapidated rustic houses) can also be used as non-agricultural living space. This allows farming families to legally remain in the farmhouse even after abandoning the farm or sell it to non-farmers.",0.51 ,0.22 
"The new constitution contains a complete catalogue of fundamental rights and enshrines, among other things, the right to non-discrimination. It also includes the so-called social objectives, according to which the Confederation and cantons must ensure that every person participates in social security, receives the necessary health care, finds employment and housing, and has access to education. Sustainable development and equal opportunities are enshrined as objectives, and the primacy of international law is explicitly mentioned for the first time. People's rights remain untouched (see, however, Bill 493).",-0.33 ,0.74 
"The completely revised Asylum Act incorporates existing law and introduces the following important innovations: 1. It grants temporary protection to ""war displaced persons."" The Federal Council makes the fundamental decision on a case-by-case basis as to whether and how many people from a war zone are granted protection. These individuals are admitted without complex individual procedures, but only temporarily – until their return to their home country or country of origin is possible. 2. To facilitate the return and reintegration of asylum seekers and those seeking protection in their home country, the federal government can finance projects in Switzerland and abroad. 3. Changes to the asylum procedure: For example, the suspension of deadlines during vacations and holidays is lifted, and women's concerns and the special needs of unaccompanied minors are better taken into account in the law. 4. Changes to welfare: This no longer lies with aid organizations, but with the cantons. 5. Provisions on the protection and processing of personal data.",0.15 ,-0.27 
"The aim of the federal decree on urgent measures in the area of ​​asylum and foreign nationals, which has already entered into force, is to combat abusive behavior at the very beginning of asylum applications. It essentially involves the following measures: Foreign nationals who are illegally residing in Switzerland and who solely seek to delay their impending deportation by applying for asylum will be denied a comprehensive asylum procedure – unless there is evidence of persecution in their home country or country of origin. The same applies to individuals who fail to submit identification documents when submitting their application or who deceive the asylum authorities about their identity. Asylum seekers whose procedures are already underway and who are facing deportation must cooperate in obtaining travel documents; otherwise, they may be detained pending deportation. Finally, foreign nationals who enter the country despite an existing entry ban can be placed in preparatory detention to determine their residency status.",0.08 ,-0.64 
"Until a new narcotics law comes into force, this federal decree provides the legal basis for continuing to prescribe heroin as a treatment for a clearly defined group of severely addicted individuals. Heroin will only be administered by specialized institutions and only to adults who have been addicted to drugs for at least two years and have already undergone two other unsuccessful treatments.",-0.34 ,0.42 
"As austerity measures, the Federal Council and Parliament propose the abolition of the supplementary pension for married couples and – this is the truly controversial part of the proposal – the quarter pensions.",0.62 ,0.02 
"The vote will focus on the introduction of maternity insurance, which would guarantee working mothers 80% of their income for 14 weeks after birth and a basic benefit for non-working mothers. To finance this, the existing fund of the EO will be converted into a joint fund of the EO and maternity insurance, which will initially be funded from the EO's surpluses and, at a later date, through an increase in value-added tax, which would then be decided by the people and the cantons. If the people and the cantons reject such an increase, the federal government can increase wage contributions by 0.2 percent.",-0.60 ,0.32 
"Access to an independent court is now guaranteed for all legal disputes. Lower courts are created for almost all legal cases. In addition, restrictions on access to the Federal Supreme Court are regulated. This stipulates that access to the Federal Supreme Court may be excluded by law for certain subject matters, and that a limit on the value of the dispute may be introduced for cases without fundamental legal significance. The federal government is granted the authority to introduce uniform civil and criminal procedural law for the whole of Switzerland. Furthermore, the Federal Supreme Court is guaranteed autonomy in the administration of the courts, voting rights appeals are introduced at the federal level, and the possibility is created for cantons to establish joint judicial authorities (e.g., juvenile courts). Last but not least, judicial independence is also constitutionally guaranteed.",0.00 ,0.60 
"The initiative requires that a referendum on a fully formulated popular initiative must take place no later than twelve months after its submission. If the Federal Assembly drafts a counterproposal, this deadline can be extended by a further year with the consent of the initiative committee.",0.00 ,0.18 
"The subject of the vote is the revision of various constitutional articles, which would introduce quota regulations for federal authorities, namely the National Council, the Council of States, the Federal Council, and the Federal Supreme Court. They set a 40% quota for women for the latter, while differentiated solutions are provided for the various councils: In the National Council, the difference between the number of men and women elected in a canton may not exceed one; in the Council of States, those cantons with two seats each send one man and one woman; and in the Federal Council, at least three of the seven members must be women. No explicit quota is formulated for the federal administration, state-run enterprises, and universities, although women should be ""adequately"" represented here as well.",-0.20 ,0.75 
"The popular initiative ""to protect people from manipulation in reproductive technology (Initiative for Humane Reproduction)"" calls for a constitutional ban on procreation outside the female body (IVF) and the use of third-party gametes for artificial insemination (heterologous procedures/sperm donation) (Article 119, paragraph 2, letters c and g, of the Federal Constitution). If the initiative is passed, the law on reproductive medicine passed by Parliament must be amended; if rejected, it will enter into force shortly after the vote.",0.00 ,-0.95 
"The Federal Constitution should be amended as follows: The Confederation, cantons, and municipalities shall halve motorized road traffic within ten years of the adoption of the initiative. The new level may not be exceeded. The decisive factor is the total mileage traveled in Switzerland. Public transport is not included. The means to be used for halving the traffic volume shall be determined by law.",-0.65 ,0.80 
"If the federal resolution is adopted, agreements on scientific and technological cooperation, on aspects of public procurement, on mutual recognition of conformity assessments, on trade in agricultural products, on air transport, on the movement of persons and goods, and on the free movement of persons will be approved. The Federal Council will be authorized to ratify these agreements. Furthermore, the Federal Assembly will be empowered to decide, by means of a federal resolution subject to referendum, on the continuation of the Free Movement Agreement and its extension to new EU member states.",0.40 ,0.30 
"According to the initiative, the federal government should promote the use of solar energy as well as the efficient and sustainable use of energy. To this end, it should levy an indexed levy of 0.1 centimes, rising to 0.5 centimes per kilowatt-hour, on the consumption of non-renewable energy. At least half of the levy revenue should be used for solar energy use.
According to the counterproposal, the federal government should levy a dedicated levy of 0.3 centimes per kilowatt-hour on non-renewable energy. The revenue should be used for: the promotion of solar energy, geothermal energy, energy from wood and biomass, the efficient use of energy, and the maintenance and renewal of domestic hydroelectric power plants. One-quarter of the revenue should be used for each measure. This authority expires ten years after the implementing legislation comes into force. It can be extended for a maximum of five years.",-0.47 ,0.62 
"According to the counterproposal, the Federal Constitution should be amended as follows: The federal government shall levy a levy on non-renewable energy sources. This levy is part of energy and environmental policy. The proceeds shall be used to reduce mandatory non-wage labor costs. This shall take into account whether and to what extent individual energy sources are subject to additional levies. The levy takes into account the competitiveness of the economy and will be introduced in stages. The maximum energy levy rate shall be 0.20 cents per kilowatt hour.",-0.10 ,0.25 
"The initiative, also known as the ""18 Percent Initiative,"" requires that the proportion of foreign residents in Switzerland may not exceed 18% of the total population. Asylum seekers, as well as those granted temporary admission and war refugees who have been in Switzerland for more than one year, must be included in the calculation. Qualified scientists, managers, artists, schoolchildren, and students are not included.",0.40 ,-0.90 
"The Federal Constitution should be amended as follows: 50,000 eligible voters or eight cantons may request a vote on a counterproposal to a federal law if at least 5 percent of the members of a council have approved the counterproposal. Voters may choose either the federal law or the counterproposal. If there are several mutually exclusive counterproposals, contingency votes will be held.",0.00 ,0.30 
"According to the popular initiative ""For a more flexible AHV system – against raising the retirement age for women,"" Article 112 of the Federal Constitution (BV) is to establish the introduction of a so-called retirement pension for women and men from the age of 62. At the age of 62, the old-age pension could be received in full if the person ceases to work or if only a low income is earned. The legislature would have to determine at what age the old-age pension could be received unconditionally (regardless of any income).
The popular initiative ""For a flexible retirement age from 62 for women and men"" also aims to make the AHV system more flexible and achieve equality between men and women with regard to retirement age. In addition to the full receipt of an old-age pension upon giving up employment from the age of 62, this initiative provides for the possibility of receiving a portion of the pension if the person partially ceases to work. Here, too, the legislature would have to determine the age at which the old-age pension could be drawn unconditionally (regardless of any income). Furthermore, it could lower the retirement age and provide for early withdrawal under certain conditions.",-0.55 ,0.40 
"According to the initiators' wishes, national defense spending should be reduced to half of its 1987 level within ten years, and one-third of the funds thus released should be used for additional international peace policy. The federal government will promote the restructuring of businesses and administrations affected by disarmament. In addition, a conversion fund of one billion Swiss francs will be established to create replacement jobs.",-0.50 ,0.50 
"The initiative aims to limit mandatory health insurance coverage to hospital stays by amending paragraph 2 of Article 34bis of the Federal Constitution. Insurers will pay a flat rate of CHF 250 (indexed) per patient per day toward the cost of hospital stays, regardless of the actual costs. Those wishing to continue to be insured for outpatient or day-care treatment must take out supplementary insurance.",0.65 ,-0.20 
"The new framework law for federal personnel contains few detailed provisions. However, the key change is the replacement of civil servant status with permanent, terminable contracts, with a comprehensive list of possible grounds for termination. Furthermore, the rigid, automated salary development processes are replaced by regular, salary-based personnel assessments. There is a general alignment with the provisions of the Swiss Code of Obligations, which apply to approximately three million employees in Switzerland. Compared to the old Civil Service Act of 1927, it allows employers (administrations, postal service, SBB, etc.) more flexibility.",0.50 ,0.00 
"According to the initiative, the Federal Constitution should be amended as follows: Switzerland participates in the European integration process and, to this end, seeks accession to the European Union. The Confederation shall commence accession negotiations with the European Union without delay.",0.20 ,0.70 
"The popular initiative ""for lower drug prices"" demands that all medications approved in Switzerland's neighboring countries be allowed to be sold in Switzerland without further control. Furthermore, only the most affordable medications should be reimbursed through basic insurance. If generic drugs (imitations of original drugs) exist, they must be dispensed or prescribed.",-0.60 ,0.30 
"The Federal Constitution should be amended as follows: The general speed limit in built-up areas is 30 km/h. The competent authority may increase the speed limit on main roads if the safety of road users and the protection of residents from noise permit. Within one year of the adoption of this article, the authorities shall issue the corresponding speed limits.",-0.09 ,0.41 
"The Federal Armaments Act contains the following provisions:
Peacebuilding missions can be ordered on the basis of a UN or OSCE mandate. They must comply with the principles of Swiss foreign policy and be carried out by specially trained individuals or troops. Participation is voluntary. The Federal Council determines the type of armament on a case-by-case basis.

Participation in hostilities is prohibited. If the mission is to be armed, the Federal Council consults the relevant committees of both councils in advance. Larger missions must be approved by the Federal Assembly.",0.00 ,-0.16

"The people and the cantons vote on the debt brake (supplement to Articles 126 and 159 of the Federal Constitution). The goal of the debt brake is to ensure a lasting balance of federal finances in a manner that is compatible with the economy. The Federal Constitution stipulates the following:
1. Expenditures must be based on revenues; 2. The current economic situation must be taken into account. Deficits are permitted in economically difficult times, but these must be offset by surpluses in subsequent years of good economic growth; 3. In exceptional circumstances, it is possible to deviate from the debt brake; 4. This increase in total expenditure requires the approval of a majority of the members of each of the two chambers (qualified majority).",0.75 ,-0.30 
"The Federal Constitution should be amended as follows: The federal government shall levy a tax on non-renewable energy and on electricity from hydroelectric power plants to finance social security. If the retirement age is lowered, the proceeds will cover the resulting additional costs. Furthermore, the revenue will be used to achieve a socially acceptable reduction in contributions to the Old Age and Survivors' Insurance (AHV), Disability Insurance (IV), Social Security (EO), and Unemployment Insurance (ALV). Non-working persons who do not reach a minimum income specified by law will receive a tax refund. The energy tax will be introduced in regular, predictable steps. The law may provide for temporary tax relief in cases of hardship.",-0.60 ,0.20 
"The Federal Constitution should be amended as follows: Switzerland has no army; no one may maintain military forces. Participation in international peacekeeping efforts is exempt from this rule. Civilian tasks will be assumed by civilian authorities. The federal government's security policy is aimed at reducing injustices and promoting equal opportunities between genders, social groups, and peoples, as well as a sustainable distribution of natural resources.",-0.80 ,0.95 
The initiative calls for the creation of a civilian peace service as an instrument of an active peace policy. This service should contribute to reducing violence at home and abroad and prevent its reemergence. Participation in the civilian peace service should be voluntary and adequately compensated.,-0.35 ,0.70 
"The initiative calls for an amendment to Article 41ter of the Federal Constitution. This stipulates that the federal government will levy a special tax of at least 20 percent on realized capital gains from private financial investments that are exempt from direct federal tax. Capital losses should be allowed to be offset against capital gains in the tax year and for a maximum of two subsequent years. Minor gains should remain tax-free. If no law is in force within three years of the popular initiative's adoption, the Federal Council would have to issue the necessary implementing provisions.",-0.70 ,0.00 
"An initiative calling for Switzerland's accession to the United Nations (UN) is then put to a referendum.
The Federal Constitution is supplemented by a transitional provision in Article 197, which states: ""Switzerland shall accede to the United Nations"" and authorizes the Federal Council to submit an application for accession.
Although the application for accession itself is not part of the referendum, the Federal Council nevertheless publishes the planned letter before the ballot for tactical reasons, as it explicitly states:""Switzerland remains neutral even as a member of the United Nations""
(Explanatory Notes by the Federal Council, p. 9). In doing so, it attempts to counter objections based on neutrality policy, which still consider UN accession incompatible with Swiss neutrality.",0.00 ,0.60 
"The people and the cantons will decide on the creation of an Article 34a of the Federal Constitution and an Article 24 of the transitional provisions. The initiative calls for a gradual reduction of the maximum annual working time by 52 hours per year to 1,872 hours, as well as a strict limitation of permissible overtime to a maximum of 100 hours per year and a maximum weekly working time of 48 hours. For incomes below one and a half times the average wage, salaries should not be reduced. Companies that reduce their employees' working hours by at least 10% within one year will receive temporary federal support.",-0.69 ,0.24 
"The subject of the 2002 vote was the revision of the Criminal Code and the establishment of a time limit for abortion. In the future, a pregnancy should be able to be terminated without penalty in the first twelve weeks, provided the woman claims personal hardship, is made aware of state counseling services, and has the abortion performed in a clinic or practice designated by the canton. After this time limit has expired, an abortion will remain unpunished, as before, if, in the opinion of a doctor, it is necessary to protect the pregnant woman from serious physical or psychological harm.",0.00 ,0.62 
"In 2002, the people had to decide on the inclusion of a constitutional article that gives the protection of unborn life top priority. According to this article, abortion should only be performed without punishment if an acute, physically based threat to the life of the pregnant woman cannot be averted in any other way. At the same time, the cantons are obligated to provide pregnant women in distress with the necessary assistance, and they can entrust this task to private institutions.",0.00 ,-0.74 
"This reform would, for example, allow the SNB to sell part of its gold reserves and invest the proceeds profitably. This concern was taken into account in the draft of a new Federal Constitution (BV). Instead of requiring banknote circulation to be covered by gold and foreign currency reserves, the central bank would be required to build up sufficient foreign currency reserves.",0.59 ,0.08 
"The core elements of the law are as follows: Consumers can freely choose their supplier. Suppliers are obligated to supply their customers with sufficient electricity. Grid owners operate their facilities safely, comprehensively, and reliably. The transmission grid is operated by a national private company (the Swiss Grid Company). State controls ensure that grid prices are set according to uniform criteria. Unjustifiably high prices are prevented. The transition period is six years. Domestic renewable energies (hydro, wind, solar, biomass) are promoted. The federal government can provide loans to hydroelectric power plants for ten years after this law comes into force.",0.40 ,0.30 
"The initiative calls for the addition of a new paragraph 1a to Article 121, paragraph 1 of the Federal Constitution. This paragraph stipulates that, in the area of ​​asylum, the federal government, subject to international legal obligations, should observe not only procedural but also criminal and welfare law principles, thereby reducing Switzerland's attractiveness as a country of asylum. The central concern of the initiators is the introduction of a new third-country regulation: Asylum applications from persons who have entered Switzerland via a third country designated as safe (e.g., our neighboring countries) should no longer be accepted. Furthermore, they call for sanctions against scheduled airlines that transport asylum seekers to Switzerland without valid travel documents. Finally, they demand further reductions in social assistance benefits for asylum seekers and temporarily admitted persons.",0.30 ,-0.78 
"The revision of the AVIG currently up for vote essentially brings the following changes: 1. The federal government and cantons will contribute to the unemployment insurance system with fixed annual contributions of CHF 300 million and CHF 100 million, respectively; 2. The social partners' contributions will be reduced from 3 to 2 percent of wages; 3. The solidarity contribution of 2% will be abolished; if the unemployment insurance system's debts amount to CHF 5 billion or more, a corresponding contribution of 1% will be levied; 4. The contribution period for entitlement to unemployment benefits will be increased from 6 to 12 months, with exceptions; 5. The period of entitlement to unemployment benefits will be reduced from 520 to 400 days, with exceptions for certain groups of persons. Furthermore, the cantons may, under certain circumstances, regionally and temporarily, extend the period of entitlement. 6. High severance payments (over CHF 106,800) upon termination of employment will delay the receipt of benefits. 7. During illness, pregnancy, and after childbirth, the duration of unemployment benefits is extended for unemployed individuals. Eligibility for unemployment benefits after raising children is easier. Furthermore, there are a number of other minor adjustments to benefit the unemployed.",0.37 ,0.04 
"A proposal will be put to the ballot, which essentially comprises two innovations: first, the introduction of the so-called general popular initiative (Article 139 of the Federal Constitution): 100,000 eligible voters will be able to submit a generally formulated proposal to demand that a bill be drafted at the constitutional or legislative level that achieves their goals. If the initiators are subsequently dissatisfied with the implementation of their proposal, they can file an appeal with the Federal Supreme Court; if Parliament refuses to draft a proposal, the people will decide on the general proposal; Parliament is then obligated to draft an implementation draft if a majority so requests. Second, the optional referendum on international treaties will be expanded (Article 141 of the Federal Constitution): From now on, the optional referendum will no longer apply only to those international treaties that involve multilateral legal harmonization, but rather to all international treaties that ""contain important legislative provisions or whose implementation requires the enactment of federal laws"" (paragraph 1).",0.00 ,0.37 
"The urgent federal law on the adjustment of cantonal contributions to hospital treatment, which is retroactive to the beginning of 2002, regulates the gradual adjustment of cantonal contributions to the treatment costs of privately and semi-privately insured patients in public or subsidized hospitals in 2002, 2003, and 2004: In 2002, the cantons will cover 60%, in 2003 80%, and in 2004 100% of the amount owed. This is a transitional solution until the planned revision of hospital financing in the Health Insurance Act.",-0.45 ,-0.10 
"Key points of the army reform are: Military personnel will be discharged from service earlier than before, with soldiers generally being discharged at the age of 30. This will reduce the army by around a third. Recruit school will be extended, to 18 or 21 weeks, depending on the branch of the military. This will be followed by six or seven refresher courses of three weeks each. The duration of the training service will thus be reduced. Up to 15 percent of each recruit cohort will be able to complete the entire 300-day service in one go. The structure of the army will be simplified by eliminating corps, divisions, and regiments; the basic building blocks are now brigades and battalions. Finally, the powers of Parliament will be expanded, while those of the Federal Council will be somewhat restricted.",0.11 ,-0.28 
"According to the new federal law, the purpose of civil protection is to ""protect the population and their livelihoods in the event of disasters and emergencies, as well as in the event of armed conflict (...)."" The police, fire department, health services, technical services, and civil protection work closely together. The Federal Council coordinates civil protection. For members of the civil protection service, compulsory service now ends at age 40 instead of 50, and discharged military personnel are no longer required to perform protective service. Basic training is extended from one to a maximum of three weeks.",0.05 ,-0.19 
"The initiative calls for the automatic adjustment of rents to reflect falling mortgage costs. The average interest rate of the last five years should serve as the basis. Rent increases during the tenancy are only possible in the event of rising costs, additional services, and as inflation compensation, but no longer on the grounds of insufficient returns or adjustment to local rents. Furthermore, protection against termination is also being expanded. This allows tenants to challenge not only abusive but also ""unjustified"" terminations. The burden of proof that a termination is based on legitimate interests and is proportionate lies with the landlord.",-0.70 ,0.34 
"The Federal Constitution is to be amended by a new Article 24. This provides for one car-free Sunday per season, with public transport remaining guaranteed. A period of nine months is set for the establishment of implementing provisions and exceptions in a regulation. In the fourth year after the first car-free Sunday, the people and the cantons are to vote on the indefinite continuation of the regulation.",-0.30 ,0.50 
"First, the initiative calls for a new financing system for compulsory health insurance (amendment to Art. 34bis of the Federal Constitution). This would be funded from contributions from insured persons and, from now on, up to half from additional VAT percentages. The exact VAT rate would be set, if the initiative is adopted, based on current costs. Contributions from insured persons would no longer be levied as per capita premiums, but would be graduated according to income and assets.
Second, the initiative aims to enshrine in the constitution the mandate for the federal and cantonal governments to ensure effective cost containment in the healthcare system. To this end, a number of competencies in healthcare and health insurance—such as the planning and management of advanced medical care, prices for medical services, tariffs, and the licensing of service providers—would be transferred from the cantons to the federal government.",-0.85 ,0.23 
"The ""Equal Rights for People with Disabilities"" initiative will be put to a vote on May 18, 2003, and calls for an amendment to the new Federal Constitution. According to this, the federal government must ensure equal treatment for people with disabilities through legislation and take measures to eliminate and compensate for existing disadvantages faced by people with disabilities. This demand of the initiative is already largely met by Article 8, Paragraph 4 of the new Federal Constitution. The second part of the initiative is particularly important to the initiators. It calls for constitutionally guaranteed, legally enforceable access for people with disabilities to buildings and facilities, or to the use of facilities and services intended for the public, as far as economically reasonable.",-0.28 ,0.75 
"The Federal Constitution should be amended as follows: Nuclear power plants will be gradually shut down. The reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel will be discontinued. The Federal Government will enact legal regulations, in particular concerning the conversion of the electricity supply to non-nuclear energy sources, avoiding substitution with electricity from fossil-fuel plants, the permanent storage of radioactive waste, the co-decision rights of the affected municipalities, and the assumption by the operators of all costs associated with the decommissioning of nuclear power plants. The Beznau 1, Beznau 2, and Mühleberg nuclear power plants are to be decommissioned no later than two years after the adoption of this initiative; the Gösgen and Leibstadt nuclear power plants are to be decommissioned no later than after 30 years of operation, i.e., by 2008 and 2014, respectively.",-0.60 ,0.65 
"The Federal Constitution should be amended as follows: If a nuclear power plant is to remain in operation for longer than 40 years, a federal resolution subject to a referendum is required. The operating period may be extended by a maximum of ten years at a time. The operator's application for an extension must, in particular, provide information about the plant's aging status and the planned safety measures. Furthermore, the federal government should issue regulations regarding the declaration of the origin and type of electricity production.",-0.34 ,0.51 
"The Federal Constitution should be amended as follows: The right to adequate vocational training is guaranteed. The Confederation and cantons shall ensure a sufficient supply. The Confederation shall establish a vocational training fund, which shall be financed through a vocational training levy paid by all employers. The costs of the apprenticeships offered shall be taken into account.",-0.65 ,0.30 
"According to the initiative, the Constitution should have been amended as follows: The Confederation shall promote the appropriate performance of transport infrastructure. It shall promote the expansion and maintenance of road and rail infrastructure and contribute to the elimination of capacity bottlenecks. Roads as part of international and national networks, as well as bypass roads, are exempt from the Alpine protection article. Construction work between Geneva and Lausanne, Bern and Zurich, and Erstfeld and Airolo must have begun no later than ten years after the adoption of this article.

The counter-proposal contains the same general provisions in the first two sentences. In addition, it stipulates the following: The construction of additional lanes between Amsteg and Airolo, as well as bypass roads, are exempt from the Alpine protection article. The Federal Council shall propose to Parliament, one year after the adoption of this article, a program for the completion and expansion of the motorway network and for contributions to the improvement of infrastructure in urban areas. The measures concern roads and rail. Implementation will be financed by a fund.",0.44 ,-0.29 
"Thus, rent increases would only be possible if costs rise, but no longer by citing insufficient returns or higher comparable rents. Compared to current law, the proposal introduces several significant changes. For example, a rent is no longer abusive if it results in a translated return, but rather if the rent exceeds a statistical benchmark by more than 15%. Furthermore, rent increases can no longer be justified by increased mortgage interest rates or adjustment to the local standard. Only the passing on of inflation (up to 100%) is permitted. Furthermore, rent increases following a change of ownership or renovations may only be staggered over time. The maximum annual increase may not exceed a certain percentage (10 or 20%) of the previous rent. Tenants can have their rent reviewed every five years based on a comparable rent.",-0.80 ,0.10 
"The Federal Constitution should be amended as follows: If a sexual or violent offender is deemed extremely dangerous and untreatable, he or she must be detained for the rest of his or her life. Early release and parole are excluded. New expert opinions may only be prepared if new scientific findings prove that the offender can be cured. Expert opinions must be prepared by at least two independent experts.",0.00 ,-0.80 
"The 11th AHV revision provides for the following measures: 1. The retirement age for women will be increased from 64 to 65 starting in 2009, and at the same time, options for more flexible retirement will be improved. Women and men can now receive half pensions from the age of 59 or full pensions from the age of 62. To compensate for the longer period of receipt, pensions will be reduced permanently. 2. Future widows' and widowers' pensions will be gradually reduced from 80 to 60 percent of an old-age pension. At the same time, orphans' pensions will be increased from 40 to 60 percent. Childless widows will receive a one-time compensation equal to an annual widow's pension instead of a pension. 3. AHV pensions will generally only be adjusted to reflect wage and price developments every three years (previously two). 4. The monthly tax allowance of CHF 1,400, on which employed persons of retirement age currently pay no contributions, will be abolished.",0.50 ,-0.25 
Vote on a constitutional amendment proposed by the Federal Council and Parliament to immediately (from 2005) increase the value added tax (VAT) by 0.8 percentage points in favor of the disability insurance (IV) and to increase the value added tax by one percentage point in favor of the old-age and survivors' insurance (AHV) if necessary. The Federal Council would only request this increase in favor of the old-age and survivors' insurance (AVS) from Parliament if the AHV finances truly required it. A referendum could be held against the corresponding resolution.,-0.40 ,0.00 
"1. Reform of married couple and family taxation: A partial tax splitting principle will be introduced, substantially reducing tax progression and thus taxes for married couples and families. Furthermore, higher (child) deductions will be introduced. Single parents and married couples with or without children will benefit from a total of more than CHF 1.5 billion in direct federal tax relief alone. If adopted, the provisions will enter into force at the federal level in 2005. By 2010 at the latest, all cantons must also adopt the splitting model and are obligated to include deductions for childcare costs and health insurance premiums in their tax laws.

2. Reform of residential property taxation: The taxation of owner-occupied residential property, the so-called imputed rental value, will be abolished. In return, deductions for interest on debt and maintenance costs on this residential property will be eliminated. However, there are exceptions to the promotion of home ownership: First, new buyers can deduct between CHF 7,500 and CHF 15,000 of interest on their mortgage during the first five years. Second, maintenance costs exceeding CHF 4,000 for the primary residence are deductible. There are also additional building savings models. This reform will result in a reduction in direct federal tax revenue of CHF 480 million.
3. Revision of stamp duties: The exemption of Swiss investment funds and foreign institutional investors from stamp duty on securities trading, which was urgently introduced in previous years but for a limited period (until 2002), is to be incorporated into ordinary law. New additions include, among others, the exemption of so-called corporates, i.e., foreign companies whose shares are listed on a recognized stock exchange. This revision results in a permanent federal revenue shortfall of CHF 310 million, with CHF 240 million already temporarily lost until 2002.",0.50 ,-0.11

The law, which was revised at the same time (which is not subject to the vote), specifies that naturalization fees may not exceed costs, and that applicants must also be between 14 and 24 years old and have resided in the municipality of naturalization for at least two years.

"The redesign of the division of responsibilities and fiscal equalization provides for the revision of 27 constitutional articles and pursues four objectives. 1. The unbundling of responsibilities: This is achieved through a reorganization of responsibilities according to the principle of subsidiarity, whereby the Confederation only assumes tasks that exceed the power of the cantons or that require uniform regulation. 2. New forms of cooperation: These regulate common areas of responsibility and distinguish between joint tasks and intercantonal cooperation. For joint tasks, the Confederation and cantons share responsibility and financing, and the cantons are granted greater scope for action. Intercantonal cooperation is to be promoted through clear regulations (performance compensation, participation rights), and the Confederation can declare intercantonal agreements generally binding.
3. The reform of fiscal equalization distinguishes between resource equalization and burden equalization. With the former, the federal government and financially strong cantons support resource-poor cantons,
whereby financial flows are no longer calculated based on expenditures,
but rather on a resource index based on tax revenues; with the instrument of burden equalization, cantons
with mountainous regions and core cities are intended to be compensated by the federal government and other cantons for
these special burdens. 4. Finally, a temporary hardship compensation is intended to ensure that no resource-poor canton is worse off than before during the transition to the new system.",-0.28 ,0.21

"The fifth revision of the IVG pursues two main goals: More disabled people will remain employed, and IV expenditures will be reduced. Specifically, the fifth IV revision introduces, first, a system of early detection and intervention. Integration measures such as retraining, job placement, and career counseling will be implemented more quickly, and support from specialists will be intensified. Furthermore, employers can now also report impending disability; they will receive professional and financial support to ensure continued employment or the integration of disabled people. Since a large portion of the new pensions will be awarded to people with mental disabilities, efforts to ensure their continued employment or integration will be intensified. In the future, only those who, despite all reasonable efforts, can no longer be employed will receive a pension. Second, the IV is reducing its spending with the following targeted benefit restrictions: cancellation of ongoing supplementary pensions for spouses of IV pensioners; no career supplement will be granted for new pensions (this has previously been granted to insured persons if they become disabled before they reach the age of 45); cancellation of daily allowances during rehabilitation measures for insured persons who were previously unemployed; financing of medical measures for the rehabilitation of those over 20 through health insurance instead of through the IV.",0.34 ,0.15

Overall, the procedure is complex and confusing, not least due to the requirements of the bicameral system. Such a complicated procedure is impractical and, in particular, time-consuming. A process for implementing a popular request that takes over seven years and is difficult for outsiders to understand undermines trust in political institutions.

"Six out of ten Swiss people oppose a third gender in official documents. This opinion has remained largely unchanged over the past year. The rejection is stronger among men compared to women.

According to a survey by the Leewas Institute for “20 Minuten” and Tamedia, 43% of women support a “diverse” gender entry, similar to the system in Germany. In contrast, only 35% of men support this change.

Overall, 57% of the population rejects the idea of a “diverse” gender entry. This is a slight decrease from last year, when the rejection rate was 62%.

Political affiliations also play a significant role in opinions on this matter. The SVP shows the least support, with only 16% in favor of a third gender. Meanwhile, 67% of SP members, 64% of Greens, and 58% of GLP members are open to the idea. The FDP and Center Party show moderate support, with 39% and 37% approval, respectively, close to the national average.

"Forecasters are split on whether the Swiss National Bank (SNB) will maintain or lower the key interest rate next Thursday. Out of 20 economists surveyed by AWP, 12 predict the SNB will keep the rate at 1.50%, while eight anticipate a reduction to 1.25%.

There is no clear consensus among economists, with some admitting their predictions are only slightly better than chance. This uncertainty follows the SNB’s unexpected rate cut from 1.75% to 1.50% in March, which was the first move by a leading central bank to signal a change in interest rates.

Arguments for both sides hinge on inflation and economic conditions. Those favoring a rate cut cite the “moderate inflation trend,” noting core inflation at 1.2%, close to the SNB’s target range of 0-2%. They highlight May’s inflation rate of 1.4%, which, despite challenges like the rent effect, shows a positive inflation outlook, according to Brian Mandt from Luzerner Kantonalbank.

Conversely, some see signs that inflationary pressure may be increasing again, with rising wages potentially fueling inflation through second-round effects, making a rate cut less likely.

Economic growth also divides opinion. Advocates for a rate cut point to weak growth in the service sector and continued industrial sector weakness. However, ZKB Chief Economist David Marmet notes the industry’s outlook is brightening, and with the service sector still robust, monetary support may not be necessary. At 1.5%, the SNB retains enough flexibility to react to any crisis.

Vontobel Chief Economist Reto Cueni refers to SNB Chairman Thomas Jordan’s comments, indicating a targeted long-term interest rate around 1%. This limits the SNB’s maneuverability, leaving only two potential 0.25% cuts.

Exchange rates add to the uncertainty. Experts debate whether the Swiss franc’s recent strengthening or its previous weakness will influence the decision. Some believe the exchange rate trend could sway the interest rate decision.

Most experts expect the SNB to cut the rate again, either in June, September, or December, forecasting a year-end rate between 1.00% and 1.25%. The ECB’s rate cuts and the expected actions of the US Federal Reserve are seen as factors pushing the SNB to maintain interest rate differentials with the eurozone.",0.30 ,0.00

The decision aligns with the Security Policy Committee’s recommendation, highlighting the WEF as “a unique platform for Swiss diplomacy.” The forum advances Switzerland’s foreign and security policy interests and involves the protection of numerous foreign heads of state and ministers.

To finance the security measures, the Federal Council requested that Parliament approve CHF 7.65 million until 2027, contributing CHF 2.55 million per year.

A left-green minority’s motion to suspend the matter until the WEF Foundation disclosed its finances was rejected. They argued that the WEF should contribute more to security costs.

"The Swiss National Council aims to ban the Swiss Armed Forces from NATO exercises that train for the “Alliance case,” fearing it would compromise Swiss neutrality.

On Thursday, the upper chamber approved a motion by 118 votes to 69 with three abstentions. If the Council of States also approves, the Federal Council must amend the relevant laws.

The “Alliance case” refers to Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, stating that an attack on one NATO country is an attack on all, warranting collective defense.

Parliamentary documents indicate the National Council’s Security Committee believes defending NATO’s borders isn’t Switzerland’s duty and would align the country too closely with NATO.

Swiss Confederation President and Defense Minister Viola Amherd noted that NATO exercises now frequently include Article 5 elements. Switzerland aims to avoid participating in exercises solely focused on NATO’s border defense.

Amherd argued that the deteriorating security situation requires stronger cooperation. The motion is too restrictive, limiting the Federal Council’s flexibility. The government prefers to evaluate each participation individually, balancing security and foreign policy interests.

"Despite the SNB’s interest rate cut in March, fixed-rate mortgages in Switzerland are slightly more expensive than at the start of the year. A sideways movement is expected for the rest of 2024.

Ten-year fixed-rate mortgages have seen a slight increase, with the benchmark rate rising from 2.26% at the beginning of the year to 2.35%, according to Comparis. The 10-year swap rate and the yield on 10-year federal bonds also rose by 0.12 and 0.20 percentage points, respectively.

“The slight increases suggest that rapid interest rate cuts are now seen less optimistically than six months ago,” said Comparis financial expert Dirk Renkert. The SNB’s earlier-than-expected rate cut did not lead to anticipated cuts in the USA, affecting global monetary policies.

Comparis forecasts that interest rates for medium and long-term fixed-rate mortgages will move sideways until year-end. The expected range for ten-year fixed-rate mortgages is 2.05% to 2.40%, for five-year fixed-rate mortgages 2.00% to 2.35%, and for 15-year mortgages 2.25% to 2.60%.

Reference Interest Rate Expected to Remain Unchanged
Saron mortgages became cheaper following the SNB’s rate cut, halting the upward trend in average mortgage rates. The mortgage reference rate remained at 1.75% as of early June.

"Public Eye, a non-governmental organization, has accused Nestlé of adding too much sugar to its baby food, particularly in developing countries, and is now demanding federal intervention. The NGO is urging the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (Seco) to take legal action “against Nestlé’s unfair business practices abroad.”

Nestlé’s business methods are “unfair in several respects,” says Public Eye. The company allegedly makes “incorrect and misleading statements” about its infant formula products in low-income countries, uses “aggressive sales methods that impair consumers’ freedom of choice,” and conceals “the nature and danger of the infant formula products.”

The NGO considers it “particularly offensive and also unfair” that Nestlé does not add any sugar to the products examined in Switzerland, but does so abroad, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

Citing Article 10 of the Federal Act against Unfair Competition (UWG), which allows the federal government to take legal action “if it deems it necessary to protect the public interest,” the NGO is now demanding a federal lawsuit against Nestlé.

Public Eye insists that Seco should call on Nestlé to remove added sugar from baby food products in all countries or, at the very least, stop marketing the products as healthy and clearly declare the amount of added sugar on the products in all countries.

"The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority Finma opened bankruptcy proceedings against Geneva-based Flowbank today, Thursday, according to a statement from the authority. The reason for this is that the bank no longer has the minimum capital required for its business operations.

In the statement, FINMA also expresses concern that the bank has a great deal of debt. The bankruptcy serves to protect depositors. “According to current calculations, the privileged deposits can be repaid in full from the bank’s available funds,” it continues.

As a first step, the bankruptcy liquidator, the law firm Walder Wyss, will quickly repay the client assets of up to CHF 100,000 to the affected clients. In addition, the clients’ securities accounts will be segregated and refunded.

Flowbank and its governing bodies were not in a position to take sustainable measures within the required timeframe to comply with the capital adequacy requirements again.

According to the press release, this is not the first time the bank has been targeted by the authority. Finma opened its first enforcement proceedings against the bank back in October 2021. Another followed last year.

Shadow banks conduct similar activities to banks but are less regulated. Walter highlighted that banks established and financed the shadow banking system, contributing to past financial crises. He suggests that the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) collect global data on non-bank credit intermediation, addressing a significant data gap.

Walter proposes adapting regulations to include bank-like lending outside the banking sector to prevent future crises. He also noted the growing connections between banks, private equity companies, credit funds, and crypto companies, which require closer scrutiny.

Walter reiterated the need for FINMA to intervene early and rectify irregularities, focusing on issues in risk culture, governance, and business models. He identified “red flags” such as incompetent boards, dominant CEOs, and disrespect for regulations as indicators of potential problems.

Walter emphasized that regulators need to adapt to evolving financial landscapes. He mentioned that indirect regulation tried after past crises, like LTCM and Archegos, was insufficient.

"In a recent survey, two-thirds of the Swiss population expressed support for abolishing existing health insurance companies in favor of a single state health insurance fund. A third of respondents would prefer to see changes or adaptations to the current model by the start of 2024. Additionally, 44% plan to review their health insurance policies in the fall.

The increased willingness to switch health insurers is adding pressure on these companies to evolve. According to a March survey by Deloitte, insurers need to develop their business models, increase efficiency, and adapt their offerings to comply with new regulations. The desire for lower premiums has not only driven this willingness to switch but also increased openness to digital solutions.

In the survey, 43% of respondents demanded attractive and modern digital offers, and three-quarters showed a willingness to use electronic patient files—a significant increase from the 35% reported in Deloitte’s 2022 survey.

Support for a single state health insurance fund was especially high in French-speaking Switzerland and Ticino, as well as among individuals aged 30 to 44. The primary motivation for 83% of those in favor was the expectation of lower premiums, with 26% believing a single fund could reduce premiums by 20%.

Respondents also identified key contributors to rising healthcare costs: 63% blamed the pharmaceutical industry, 59% cited patients themselves, 46% pointed to aging, and 43% noted more expensive treatments.

"Switzerland’s debt stability stands out in a world grappling with increasing debt burdens and rising interest rates. The global debt crisis has reached unprecedented levels, with global debt now at a staggering USD 315 trillion, according to the Institute of International Finance (IIF). Post-pandemic, tax cuts and increased spending led to heightened debts, particularly in emerging markets like China, India, and Mexico.

Emerging markets accumulated significant debt post-pandemic, now totaling USD 105 trillion, an increase of USD 55 trillion over the last decade. Countries like India risk their debt surpassing economic output by the decade’s end due to natural disaster expenditures. The depreciation of local currencies against the US dollar further exacerbates the risk, as seen in Argentina.

High inflation in developed countries like the USA forces central banks to maintain high interest rates, impacting debt costs significantly. From 2009 to 2022, US interest rates were between 0% and 2.25%, but have since risen to around 5.25%-5.50%, dramatically increasing daily interest payments. Projections by the US Congressional Budget Office (CBO) indicate that interest payments could consume 35% of federal revenue by 2051.

Switzerland, however, remains resilient. The country implemented a debt brake in 2001, stabilizing its financial health. Without this measure, Switzerland’s debt would be 56% instead of the current 15%, saving the government CHF 4 billion annually in interest. This financial prudence fosters confidence, reflected in low interest rates and a strong currency. Economists emphasize that such stability provides crucial maneuvering space in crises.

Despite its stability, Switzerland isn’t entirely immune to global risks. As an export-oriented nation, it faces potential repercussions from global financial crises and market instabilities. However, Switzerland’s robust financial policies offer a protective cushion against these external threats.",0.70 ,0.00 
"The trade union Unia says it is aware of various cases of harassment at the luxury watch manufacturer Rolex. According to Unia, Rolex has unlawfully dismissed victims of this harassment, prompting the union to take the case to the labor court.

On Monday, Unia reported “dozens” of harassment cases among employees at Rolex headquarters in Geneva. “For years, cases of repeated harassment have been reported to the union in the Rolex global service business department in Geneva,” union secretary Alejo Patiño told the media. Unia has received around 50 witness statements.

The union attempted to find solutions with Rolex but faced “blockades.” “At first, they completely denied everything,” said Patiño. Rolex later agreed to an internal investigation and then an external audit. However, these investigations did not result in the measures demanded by the employees being implemented.

Around 15 employees reported the situation to the cantonal labor inspection office (OCIRT). The OCIRT then submitted a request for compliance with the regulations.

At Unia’s headquarters in Bern, employees described a superior who had harassed them for years and created a toxic atmosphere. Despite knowing about this, the company had protected this employee. A former employee also reported being dismissed after standing up to the harassment.

Because employees who wanted to take action against the manager were dismissed, the union will file a complaint with the labor court for “abusive dismissal” by the end of the month.

When asked by the news agency AWP, Rolex stated that the company had “immediately taken the necessary measures to put an end to the situation” after discovering “malfunctions” in one of its departments. “The measures taken led to a complete reorganization of the department concerned,” a spokeswoman said.

Rolex claims to have “made justified dismissals in accordance with its strict rules and informed the OCIRT.” The company is actively working with the OCIRT on preventive measures and is doing everything it can to avoid such situations in the future.",-0.80 ,0.80 
"Property buyers are currently facing greater financial burdens. However, lower mortgage interest rates and sharply rising rents should reduce the home ownership premium soon. Buying should be cheaper than renting by early 2025.

According to UBS, the annual cost of a medium-sized condominium with four and a half rooms and 110 square meters of living space is currently CHF 32,500. The annual rent for such an apartment costs CHF 30,500. This results in an ownership premium of 7 %. UBS shared these insights in a study published on Monday.

In summer 2023, this premium was still 16 %. Someone who took out a long-term mortgage last summer will have to shoulder cumulative additional costs of almost CHF 50,000 by 2033 according to current forecasts.

Thanks to lower mortgage interest rates, the property premium is now significantly lower than it was in summer 2023. The premium is expected to reverse to a discount of 3 % by early 2025. The main drivers are the two key interest rate cuts still expected from the SNB.

The decline in the property premium is broadly based across regions. In the cantons of Bern, Solothurn, Aargau, Schaffhausen, and Thurgau, it is already below 5 % in many places. In some regions of Vaud, Fribourg, and Valais, there is already a property discount. In contrast, the premium in mountain regions remains high.

A property discount of 20 to 30 %, as seen during the negative interest rate phase from 2015 to early 2022, is currently a long way off. However, the falling property premium should gradually increase demand for owner-occupied homes again after the slowdown in 2022 and 2023.

The long-term financial success of a home purchase depends not only on running costs but also on land value development. According to the bank, an increase in value of just 0.4 % this year would offset the current property premium.",0.00 ,0.00 
"Swiss energy companies are relieved that the Energy Cloak Decree has been approved. From the perspective of the economy, however, it is only a first step in the right direction to secure the electricity supply in the long term.

“The vote has clearly shown that our company is aware that we cannot rest on our grandparents’ laurels,” Alpiq said at the request of the news agency AWP. The way is now clear for the rapid implementation of projects that will make the country’s energy supply possible.

The energy sector has now been given the tools to rapidly expand renewables, according to the umbrella organization Economiesuisse. Many blocked projects can now finally be realized. It is hoped that this “yes” vote will also increase public acceptance for the expansion of hydropower, alpine solar plants, and wind power.

On Sunday, almost 70 % voted in favor of the law on a secure electricity supply with renewable energies. The aim of the energy decree is to produce more domestic electricity, become less dependent on foreign countries, and secure the electricity supply in winter. The bill specifies minimum production volumes for renewable electricity and simplifies the planning of 16 hydropower plants. The Federal Council, parliament, the major parties, and important environmental associations have prevailed with the voters’ yes vote.

Following the Yes vote, Alpiq is now prioritizing the planned hydropower projects: the Gornerli and Oberaletsch projects and the raising of the Emosson, Moiry, and Sambuco dams. The Swiss energy group also intends to press ahead with Alpine photovoltaic plants (such as Gondosolar) and wind power projects (such as Belcoster).

"Chur’s voters will elect a new mayor on Sunday. The incumbent, Urs Marti (FDP), must vacate his seat due to the term limit. Three candidates are standing for the position.

Marti’s deputy, Patrik Degiacomi (SP), appears to be in the best position. As an incumbent city councillor, he has overseen the Department of Education and Culture on the three-member committee since 2017. Degiacomi has represented Marti as mayor since 2021. He was the first to announce his candidacy for the office in spring 2023. Notably, the SP has never held the presidency before.

The office has also never been held by a woman. Current city councillor Sandra Maissen (center) aims to change this. The 59-year-old has served on the city council since 2020. A lawyer and former president of the Swiss Scout Movement, Maissen currently heads the Department of Construction Planning Environment.

The FDP seeks to retain the seat. Chur municipal councillor Hans Martin Meuli aims to defend both the city council seat for the FDP and the presidency. A long-serving councillor, Meuli has been president of the municipal council and chaired the FDP parliamentary group in the city parliament for several years.

The general elections could result in shifts within the three-member city council and the municipal council. The Free List & Greens grouping, which narrowly missed out on a seat in the last elections, is also pushing for a place on the city council this year.

The Federal Council’s draft law seeks to enact a motion passed by Parliament. Currently, cantons can only comment on estimated costs. The new legislation will allow them to comment on health insurance premiums in their area before the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) approves them.

Specifically, cantons will be able to review healthcare cost estimates and premium proposals submitted by insurers. They will have access to all necessary information. “Cantons are best positioned to review cost estimates,” stated the Federal Council.

Additionally, the Federal Council proposes changes regarding the reimbursement of overpaid premiums. Currently, overpaid premiums are refunded to all insured persons.

Since the beginning of the year, cross-border commuters have been able to work from home for a quarter of their working hours without affecting the state that taxes the income or the status of cross-border commuters.

Under the cross-border commuter agreement that came into force in July 2023, Switzerland retains 80% of the withholding tax levied on the income of Italian cross-border commuters. New cross-border commuters are also appropriately taxed in their country of residence, eliminating double taxation.

"Last year, dormant assets definitively liquidated funnelled CHF 7.1 million into Switzerland’s federal coffers. A significant proportion of these assets ended up in federal hands because claimants couldn’t be traced or their eligibility couldn’t be verified.

Swiss banks occasionally lose contact with customers, often due to moves abroad or deaths. Banks follow the “Narilo Guidelines,” established in 1995, to handle such situations. If there’s no customer contact for an extended period, banks must make “reasonable” inquiries.

If the person can’t be located, assets over CHF 500 are sent to a central database accessible only to the Swiss Banking Ombudsman, who then searches for beneficiaries. Unclaimed assets get published on www.dormantaccounts.ch after 60 years, and if unclaimed for another year, they are transferred to the Federal Finance Administration (FFA).

Since 2001, the Ombudsman has identified 710 contactless accounts, transferring assets worth CHF 139.4 million to beneficiaries and accessing 73 safes. The Ombudsman also handles private inquiries about potential contactless assets. In 2023, 477 inquiries were managed, with only 18 concluded successfully.

“The average success rate since 2001 has been around 6.5%,” says Andreas Barfuss, Swiss Banking Ombudsman. The low success rate is because most applicants search for relatives’ accounts, often based on guesswork. In 2023, most applications came from Germany (151), followed by France (66) and Switzerland (49). Outside Europe, Asia (32) and North America (31) led the inquiries.

In total, returned assets amounted to CHF 1.1 million last year, down from CHF 14.1 million in 2022. The majority of processed dormant assets, CHF 7.1 million, went to the federal government.

"The Council of States is debating the army dispatch on Monday. The preliminary committee proposes increasing the army budget by CHF 4 billion over four years, surpassing the Federal Council’s suggestion. Additionally, they seek an extra CHF 660 million for air defense systems in the armaments program.

In February, the national government presented key figures on the armed forces’ strategic orientation for the next twelve years and a CHF 25.8 billion payment framework for 2025 to 2028. The Council of States’ Security Policy Committee (SIK-S) finds this insufficient and proposes CHF 29.8 billion, aiming for the army budget to reach 1 % of GDP by 2030.

The Federal Council also requests Parliament’s approval for CHF 4.9 billion in commitment credits for military equipment, the 2024 armaments program, and the Defence Department’s real estate program.

The armaments program involves CHF 490 million for mobile sensors, guided weapons, and PC-7 aircraft maintenance.

"Under the “Green Open Skies Accord,” every international flight pays into a fund that issues free intercontinental tickets to climate-refugee families and queer asylum-seekers vetted by grassroots NGOs. Airlines receive carbon-offset credits only if planes achieve life-cycle net-zero certification and cabin-crew unions ratify inclusive labour contracts. Frequent-flyer status is replaced with fair-miles tiers rewarding travellers who mentor newcomers on arrival.",-0.25 ,0.98
